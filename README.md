What is a pit stop?
“A pit stop is a pause for refuelling, new tires, repairs, mechanical adjustments, a driver change, as a penalty, or any combination of the above.”

Why are they important?
- Tire changes, refueling, etc
- Repairs or track optimizations 
- Penalties 

Pit stops and their associated strategies are essential for a race team’s success. Therefore, the decision to take a pit stop, and how long is spent stopped, is crucial to a team’s performance.

Does taking shorter and fewer pit stops increase performance (measured by points and win rate)?
