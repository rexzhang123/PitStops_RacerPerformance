# :racing_car: PitStops_RacerPerformance :checkered_flag:

This repository explores the strategic importance of pit stops in racing and how they impact a racer's performance. A pit stop can involve refueling, tire changes, repairs, mechanical adjustments, driver changes, or penalties. The project analyzes whether taking shorter and fewer pit stops correlates with better performance in terms of points and win rates.

## :toolbox: What is a Pit Stop?

A pit stop is a crucial aspect of motor racing. It is a pause during the race where a team can perform various actions such as:
- Refueling the car.
- Changing tires.
- Conducting repairs or mechanical adjustments.
- Changing drivers, or :stop_sign: serving a penalty.

## :trophy: Importance of Pit Stops

Pit stops are not just routine pauses; they carry significant strategic importance:
- Tire Changes and :fuelpump: Refueling**: Essential for maintaining optimal vehicle performance.
- Repairs or Track Optimizations**: Crucial for adapting to race conditions or recovering from wear and tear.
- Penalties**: Can affect the race strategy and overall performance.

Pit stops and their associated strategies are often a deciding factor in a race. The timing and duration of a pit stop can significantly influence a teamâ€™s overall race performance.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Project Objective

This project aims to analyze the relationship between pit stop strategies and racing performance. Specifically, it seeks to answer:
- Does taking shorter and fewer pit stops lead to an increase in performance as measured by points and win rates?
